# Practice


1. Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
Write a TensorFlow code to build a simple CNN model for image classification. Train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate its accuracy.

2. Transfer Learning:
Implement transfer learning using a pre-trained VGG-16 model on the ImageNet dataset. Fine-tune the model on a custom dataset and measure its performance.

3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Sequence Prediction:
Create a TensorFlow code to build a basic RNN model for sequence prediction. Train the model on a synthetic sequence dataset and generate predictions.

4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) with LSTM:

Write TensorFlow code to develop an LSTM model for sentiment analysis. Train the model on a dataset like IMDB movie reviews and evaluate its performance.
5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
Implement a basic GAN using TensorFlow for generating synthetic images. Train the GAN on a dataset like MNIST or Fashion-MNIST and visualize the generated images.

6. Autoencoders:
Develop an autoencoder model using TensorFlow for image denoising. Train the model on a dataset with noisy images and evaluate its denoising performance.

7. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Utilize TensorFlow's built-in functionality or libraries like Keras Tuner to perform hyperparameter tuning for a deep learning model. Optimize hyperparameters for a CNN model on the MNIST dataset.

8. Model Deployment with TensorFlow Serving:
Demonstrate how to deploy a trained TensorFlow model using TensorFlow Serving. Serve a pre-trained image classification model and make predictions on new images.

9. Custom Loss Functions:
Write TensorFlow code to implement a custom loss function for a specific deep learning task, such as image segmentation or object detection. Train a model using this custom loss function and evaluate its performance.

10. Explainable AI (XAI) Techniques:
Apply an XAI technique like Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) using TensorFlow to visualize which parts of an image are important for a model's prediction. Provide insights into model interpretability.
